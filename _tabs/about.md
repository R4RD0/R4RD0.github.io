Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ I'm Luke, a power platform developer based in the UK. My expertise lies in working with the Microsoft 365 stack and Azure. My tech background started in IT support, on the ground cableing and installing hardware. Then on the desk, where I fell in love with the magic ðŸª„ of PowerShell scripting and finding ways to streamline tasks.

That passion evolved into exploring automations like Azure Functions, Power Automate, Intune, a sprinkle of Cyber Sec and other tools to make technology work smarter, not harder. Lately, I'm focused on the Power Platform and building solutions that make everyone's day a little easier. Right now, I'm keeping an eye on AI, just like everyone else these days! ðŸ˜Ž

**Outside the Code**

When I step away from the keyboard, it's usually for family time.  If I carve out some me-time, I'm likely gaming or getting my hands dirty exploring the latest features of Unreal Engine.
