There is no post... yet.

I've been itching to share some of my great ideas on paper, the solutions to problems I've wrestled with and conquered. The trouble is, they haven't quite made it from my brain to the page. Just scribbles of rushed notes and incoherent ramblings so far. But they're there, waiting for the day they become decipherable again.

The day I have some free time to crack the code of my own madman's scribbles, to type them up and give them life. To create, script, and code the crude drawings into user interfaces, to breathe meaning into the maelstrom of thoughts. Here, as a post, or maybe even a series of them.

One day. ;)
